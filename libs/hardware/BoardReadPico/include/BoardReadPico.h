// FreeInk board support for Read Pico (小纸 Pico, RDP-G01-W): the FCA9555 expander,
// the SY7636A EPD PMIC power sequence, the CW32L010 PMU, the CST836U touch reset,
// the SD card detect and the buzzer idle state.
//
// This header is the interface the SDK seams call. It is deliberately NOT a full
// driver set: the panel bus lives in ReadPicoEpdiyConfig.cpp, the touch read lives in InputManager, and the IMU/RTC
// backends live in the Imu / Rtc libraries. The board only owns what has to be
// sequenced in hardware order and what sits on the expander or the PMU.
//
// Symbol names are frozen by docs/engineering/read-pico.md §3.4; other tasks
// depend on them verbatim.

// the expander never answered — nothing else on this board can be sequenced
// without it, so callers should treat that as fatal.

//    InputPins.power is PIN_UNASSIGNED), so getPhysicalState() can never set
//    BTN_POWER here. The level is STATUS.flags bit 5, sampled on the vendor's
//    own KEY_POLL_MS = 50 cadence because the PMU shares SDA39/SCL40 with the
//    touch controller. A failed poll reports the key released, never stuck.
//  * The three capacitive key zones in the strip of the touch panel below the
//    drawn image. Hit-tests the latched raw point set by setStripRawPoint()
//    against READPICO_KEY_CENTER_1/2/3 (split at READPICO_KEY_AREA_TOP, pitch
//    READPICO_KEY_PITCH).
//
// Returns a `1 << BTN_*` level mask, or 0 when neither source is active.

// on every sample with `down` = whether the panel currently reports a contact.
// The strip lies OUTSIDE the display frame (raw y > 1300 vs display y <= 1215),
